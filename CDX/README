Real-time Collision Detector Benchmark
--------------------------------------

Quick start: "ant"

The results presented in the paper submitted to JTRES were measured using
"hard" (COL in the paper) and "easy" (NOI in the paper) workload. The
configuration used can be found in scripts run_hard.sh and run_easy.sh.
In particular, the binary dump of the air traffic used is in input/easy.bin
and input/hard.bin.
